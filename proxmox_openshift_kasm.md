[Presenter]

---

## Current State and Drivers

### Current Environment
* Test: VMware ESXi
* Production: RHEVM (EOL Approaching)
* Remote Access: NoMachine NX
* Manual Provisioning
* Limited Configuration Management

### Driving Change
* RHEVM end-of-life
* Need for automated provisioning
* Remote access modernization
* Configuration management at scale

---

## Proposed Architecture

### Modern Automated Stack

#### 1. Infrastructure Layer
* Proxmox VE replacing VMware
* Feature parity with current stack
* API-driven automation
* 80% lower licensing costs

#### 2. Container Platform
* OpenShift replacing RHEVM
* Modern orchestration
* Natural RHEL progression
* Future-proof architecture

#### 3. Remote Access
* Kasm replacing NoMachine NX
* Browser-based solution
* Enhanced security
* Improved user experience

#### 4. Automation Layer
* Ansible integration throughout
* Infrastructure as Code
* Configuration Management
* Automated deployments

## Ansible Integration Strategy

### Infrastructure Provisioning
* Proxmox VM deployment
* OpenShift cluster management
* Network/storage configuration
* Template-based deployment

### Configuration Management
* System hardening
* Package management
* Service configuration
* Compliance enforcement

### Integration Points
* Proxmox API automation
* OpenShift operator integration
* Git-based workflow
* CI/CD pipeline integration

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1 (10 weeks)
* Proxmox deployment
* Ansible framework setup
* Initial automation development
* Test environment migration

### Phase 2 (14 weeks)
* OpenShift implementation
* RHEVM workload migration
* Automation integration
* Production migration start

### Phase 3 (8 weeks)
* Kasm deployment
* NoMachine NX phase-out
* Automation refinement
* Project completion
